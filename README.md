## Lifecycle hooks

> These are functions of our components that are called at different stages in the life cycle of a component, that is, from its creation to its destruction.

- `created(){}` logic this is call when the component are created.
- `props` inputs from components
- `components` create tags for import components (remeber to export with default and import with the same name)
